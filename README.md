# Project Euler

I am not doing these in order, just doing whatever takes my fancy. All of my solutions are written in C.

Completed, working solutions are found in the `src` directory and whatever I am working on at that moment is in the `progress` directory

As I am trying to up my language skills; I prefer to write my own methods for things like string manipulation etc. and stray from library implementations. 

## However;

Since that was written, I have solved approximately 60 Project Euler problems in C.

I have also started progress in learning Fortran, and thus these solutions live
in `for_src`.
